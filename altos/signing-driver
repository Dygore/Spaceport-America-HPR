Create a key store for our keys called AltusMetrumCertStore

Add our key from ~/altusmetrumllc/altusmetrum-key.p12

Create a new directory with a simple path. Copy altusmetrum.inf to
that directory

# <path> contains the altusmetrum.inf file we ship. Make sure <path>
# is otherwise empty or inf2cat will get confused

inf2cat /driver:<path> /os:7_X86,7_X64,8_X86,8_X64
