.SH DESCRIPTION
.I ao-cal-accel
drives the built-in accelerometer calibration and validates the results.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-T tty-device | --tty tty-device
This selects which tty device the debugger uses to communicate with
the target device. The special name 'BITBANG' directs ao-dbg to use
the cp2103 connection, otherwise this should be a usb serial port
connected to a suitable cc1111 debug node.
.TP
\-D AltOS-device | --device AltOS-device
Search for a connected device. This requires an argument of one of the
following forms:
.IP
TeleMega:2
.br
TeleMega
.br
2
.IP
Leaving out the product name will cause the tool to select a suitable
product, leaving out the serial number will cause the tool to match
one of the available devices.
.SH USAGE
.I ao-cal-accel
opens the target device, executes the accelerometer calibration
command, verifies that it executed correctly, then shows the resulting
calibration values and saves them to configuration memory.
