	EasyMini is built on a 0.8 inch by 1Â½ inch circuit board. It's
	designed to fit in a 24mm coupler tube.

	You usually don't need to configure EasyMini at all; it's set
	up to do dual-deployment with an event at apogee to separate
	the airframe and deploy a drogue and another event at 250m
	(820ft) to deploy the main. Install EasyMini in your airframe,
	hook up a battery, igniters and a power switch and you're
	ready to fly.

	=== EasyMini Screw Terminals
	
		EasyMini has two sets of four screw terminals near one end of the
		board. Using the picture
		above, the top four have connections for the main pyro
		circuit and an external battery and the bottom four have
		connections for the apogee pyro circuit and the power
		switch. Counting from the left, the connections are as follows:

	=== Connecting A Battery To EasyMini

		There are two possible battery connections on
		EasyMini. You can use either method; both feed
		through the power switch terminals.

		One battery connection is the standard Altus Metrum
		white JST plug. This mates with single-cell Lithium
		Polymer batteries sold by Altus Metrum.

		The other is a pair of screw terminals marked 'Battery
		+' and 'Battery -'. Connect a battery from 4 to 12
		volts to these terminals, being careful to match polarity.

	=== Charging Lithium Batteries

		Because EasyMini allows for batteries other than the
		standard Altus Metrum Lithium Polymer cells, it cannot
		incorporate a battery charger circuit. Therefore, when
		using a Litium Polymer cell, you'll need an external
		charger. These are available from Altus Metrum, or
		from Spark Fun.

      	=== Using a Separate Pyro Battery with EasyMini
	
		As described above, using an external pyro battery involves
		connecting the negative battery terminal to the flight
		computer ground, connecting the positive battery terminal to
		one of the igniter leads and connecting the other igniter
		lead to the per-channel pyro circuit connection.

		To connect the negative pyro battery terminal to EasyMini
		ground, connect it to the negative external battery
		connection, top terminal 4.

		Connecting the switched positive battery terminal to the pyro
		charges must be done separate from EasyMini, by soldering
		them together or using some other connector.  Note that for
		safety, you must put a switch between the pyro battery and
		the rest of the circuit!

		The other lead from each pyro charge is then inserted into
		the appropriate per-pyro channel screw terminal (top
		terminal 1 for the Main charge, bottom terminal 1 for the
		Apogee charge).

      	=== Using an Active Switch with EasyMini
	
		As explained above, an external active switch requires three
		connections, one to the positive battery terminal, one to
		the flight computer positive input and one to ground. Use
		the negative external battery connection, top terminal 4 for
		ground.

		The positive battery terminal is available on bottom
		terminal 4, the positive flight computer input is on the
		bottom terminal 3.
