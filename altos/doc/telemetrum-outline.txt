== TeleMetrum Outline and Hole Pattern
	This image, when printed, provides a precise template for the
	mounting holes in TeleMetrum. TeleMetrum has overall dimensions of
	1.000 x 2.750 inches, and the mounting holes are 0.125 inches from
	three of the board edges, and 0.375 inches from the screw terminal 
	end.  That means they are in a rectangle measuring 0.750 x 2.250
	inches, sized for use with 4-40 or M3 screws.
