== TeleGPS Outline and Hole Pattern
	This image, when printed, provides a precise template for the
	mounting holes in TeleGPS.  TeleGPS has overall dimensions
	of 1.000 x 1.500 inches, and the mounting holes are 0.125 inches
	from each board edge.  That means the mounting holes are in a 
	rectangle measuring 0.750 x 1.250 inches apart, sized for use with 
	4-40 or M3 screws.
