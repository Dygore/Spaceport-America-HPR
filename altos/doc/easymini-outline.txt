	This image, when printed, provides a precise template for the

	these products has overall dimensions of 0.800 x 1.500 inches, 
	and the mounting holes are 0.125 inches from each board edge.
	That means the mounting holes are in a rectangle measuring
	0.550 x 1.250 inches apart, sized for use with 4-40 or M3 screws.
