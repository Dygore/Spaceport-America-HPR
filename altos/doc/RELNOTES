Creating documentation for a new release of AltOS

* Write release notes in release-notes-${version}.inc.

* Make sure that doc/altusmetrum.txt has the right copyright year

* Make sure doc/altusmetrum-theme.yml has the right copyright year

* Add references to that as appropriate from each of the documents:

	release-notes.inc
	easymini-release-notes.inc
	telegps-release-notes.inc

* Add release-notes-${version}.inc to Makefile.am and git

* Make sure new hardware specs are documented in specs.inc
