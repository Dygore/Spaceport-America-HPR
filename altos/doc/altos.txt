== Overview

	AltOS is a operating system built for a variety of
	microcontrollers used in Altus Metrum devices. It has a simple
	porting layer for each CPU while providing a convenient
	operating enviroment for the developer. AltOS currently
	supports three different CPUs:

	* STM32L series from ST Microelectronics. This ARM Cortex-M3
	  based microcontroller offers low power consumption and a
	  wide variety of built-in peripherals. Altus Metrum uses this
	  in the TeleMega, MegaDongle and TeleLCO projects.

	* CC1111 from Texas Instruments. This device includes a
	  fabulous 10mW digital RF transceiver along with an
	  8051-compatible processor core and a range of
	  peripherals. This is used in the TeleMetrum, TeleMini,
	  TeleDongle and TeleFire projects which share the need for a
	  small microcontroller and an RF interface.

	* ATmega32U4 from Atmel. This 8-bit AVR microcontroller is one
	  of the many used to create Arduino boards. The 32U4 includes
	  a USB interface, making it easy to connect to other
	  computers. Altus Metrum used this in prototypes of the
	  TeleScience and TelePyro boards; those have been switched to
	  the STM32L which is more capable and cheaper.

	Among the features of AltOS are:

	* Multi-tasking. While microcontrollers often don't
	  provide separate address spaces, it's often easier to write
	  code that operates in separate threads instead of tying
	  everything into one giant event loop.

	* Non-preemptive. This increases latency for thread
	  switching but reduces the number of places where context
	  switching can occur. It also simplifies the operating system
	  design somewhat. Nothing in the target system (rocket flight
	  control) has tight timing requirements, and so this seems like
	  a reasonable compromise.

	* Sleep/wakeup scheduling. Taken directly from ancient
	  Unix designs, these two provide the fundemental scheduling
	  primitive within AltOS.

	* Mutexes. As a locking primitive, mutexes are easier to
	  use than semaphores, at least in my experience.

	* Timers. Tasks can set an alarm which will abort any
	  pending sleep, allowing operations to time-out instead of
	  blocking forever.

	The device drivers and other subsystems in AltOS are
	conventionally enabled by invoking their _init() function from
	the 'main' function before that calls
	ao_start_scheduler(). These functions initialize the pin
	assignments, add various commands to the command processor and
	may add tasks to the scheduler to handle the device. A typical
	main program, thus, looks like:

	....
	\void
	\main(void)
	\{
	\	ao_clock_init();

	\	/* Turn on the LED until the system is stable */
	\	ao_led_init(LEDS_AVAILABLE);
	\	ao_led_on(AO_LED_RED);
	\	ao_timer_init();
	\	ao_cmd_init();
	\	ao_usb_init();
	\	ao_monitor_init(AO_LED_GREEN, TRUE);
	\	ao_rssi_init(AO_LED_RED);
	\	ao_radio_init();
	\	ao_packet_slave_init();
	\	ao_packet_master_init();
	\#if HAS_DBG
	\	ao_dbg_init();
	\#endif
	\	ao_config_init();
	\	ao_start_scheduler();
	\}
	....

	As you can see, a long sequence of subsystems are initialized
	and then the scheduler is started.

== AltOS Porting Layer

	AltOS provides a CPU-independent interface to various common
	microcontroller subsystems, including GPIO pins, interrupts,
	SPI, I2C, USB and asynchronous serial interfaces. By making
	these CPU-independent, device drivers, generic OS and
	application code can all be written that work on any supported
	CPU. Many of the architecture abstraction interfaces are
	prefixed with ao_arch.

	=== Low-level CPU operations

		These primitive operations provide the abstraction needed to
		run the multi-tasking framework while providing reliable
		interrupt delivery.

		==== ao_arch_block_interrupts/ao_arch_release_interrupts

			....
			static inline void
			ao_arch_block_interrupts(void);

			static inline void
			ao_arch_release_interrupts(void);
			....

			These disable/enable interrupt delivery, they may not
			discard any interrupts. Use these for sections of code that
			must be atomic with respect to any code run from an
			interrupt handler.

		==== ao_arch_save_regs, ao_arch_save_stack, ao_arch_restore_stack

			....
			static inline void
			ao_arch_save_regs(void);

			static inline void
			ao_arch_save_stack(void);

			static inline void
			ao_arch_restore_stack(void);
			....

			These provide all of the support needed to switch
			between tasks.. ao_arch_save_regs must save all CPU
			registers to the current stack, including the
			interrupt enable state. ao_arch_save_stack records the
			current stack location in the current ao_task
			structure. ao_arch_restore_stack switches back to the
			saved stack, restores all registers and branches to
			the saved return address.

		==== ao_arch_wait_interupt

			....
			#define ao_arch_wait_interrupt()
			....

			This stops the CPU, leaving clocks and interrupts
			enabled. When an interrupt is received, this must wake up
			and handle the interrupt. ao_arch_wait_interrupt is entered
			with interrupts disabled to ensure that there is no gap
			between determining that no task wants to run and idling the
			CPU. It must sleep the CPU, process interrupts and then
			disable interrupts again. If the CPU doesn't have any
			reduced power mode, this must at the least allow pending
			interrupts to be processed.

	=== GPIO operations

	These functions provide an abstract interface to configure and
	manipulate GPIO pins.

		==== GPIO setup

			These macros may be invoked at system
			initialization time to configure pins as
			needed for system operation. One tricky aspect
			is that some chips provide direct access to
			specific GPIO pins while others only provide
			access to a whole register full of pins. To
			support this, the GPIO macros provide both
			port+bit and pin arguments. Simply define the
			arguments needed for the target platform and
			leave the others undefined.

			===== ao_enable_output

				....
				#define ao_enable_output(port, bit, pin, value)
				....

				Set the specified port+bit (also called 'pin')
				for output, initializing to the specified
				value. The macro must avoid driving the pin
				with the opposite value if at all possible.

			===== ao_enable_input

				....
				#define ao_enable_input(port, bit, mode)
				....

				Sets the specified port/bit to be an input
				pin. 'mode' is a combination of one or more of
				the following. Note that some platforms may
				not support the desired mode. In that case,
				the value will not be defined so that the
				program will fail to compile.

				* AO_EXTI_MODE_PULL_UP. Apply a pull-up to the
				  pin; a disconnected pin will read as 1.

				* AO_EXTI_MODE_PULL_DOWN. Apply a pull-down to
				  the pin; a disconnected pin will read as 0.

				* 0. Don't apply either a pull-up or
				  pull-down. A disconnected pin will read an
				  undetermined value.

		==== Reading and writing GPIO pins

			These macros read and write individual GPIO pins.

			===== ao_gpio_set

				....
				#define ao_gpio_set(port, bit, pin, value)
				....

				Sets the specified port/bit or pin to
				the indicated value

			===== ao_gpio_get

				....
				#define ao_gpio_get(port, bit, pin)
				....

				Returns either 1 or 0 depending on
				whether the input to the pin is high
				or low.
== Programming the 8051 with SDCC

	The 8051 is a primitive 8-bit processor, designed in the mists
	of time in as few transistors as possible. The architecture is
	highly irregular and includes several separate memory
	spaces. Furthermore, accessing stack variables is slow, and
	the stack itself is of limited size. While SDCC papers over
	the instruction set, it is not completely able to hide the
	memory architecture from the application designer.

	When built on other architectures, the various SDCC-specific
	symbols are #defined as empty strings so they don't affect the
	compiler.

	=== 8051 memory spaces

		The __data/__xdata/__code memory spaces below were completely
		separate in the original 8051 design. In the cc1111, this
		isn't true—they all live in a single unified 64kB address
		space, and so it's possible to convert any address into a
		unique 16-bit address. SDCC doesn't know this, and so a
		'global' address to SDCC consumes 3 bytes of memory, 1 byte as
		a tag indicating the memory space and 2 bytes of offset within
		that space. AltOS avoids these 3-byte addresses as much as
		possible; using them involves a function call per byte
		access. The result is that nearly every variable declaration
		is decorated with a memory space identifier which clutters the
		code but makes the resulting code far smaller and more
		efficient.

		==== __data

			The 8051 can directly address these 128 bytes of
			memory. This makes them precious so they should be
			reserved for frequently addressed values. Oh, just to
			confuse things further, the 8 general registers in the
			CPU are actually stored in this memory space. There are
			magic instructions to 'bank switch' among 4 banks of
			these registers located at 0x00 - 0x1F. AltOS uses only
			the first bank at 0x00 - 0x07, leaving the other 24
			bytes available for other data.

		==== __idata

			There are an additional 128 bytes of internal memory
			that share the same address space as __data but which
			cannot be directly addressed. The stack normally
			occupies this space and so AltOS doesn't place any
			static storage here.

		==== __xdata

			This is additional general memory accessed through a
			single 16-bit address register. The CC1111F32 has 32kB
			of memory available here. Most program data should live
			in this memory space.

		==== __pdata

			This is an alias for the first 256 bytes of __xdata
			memory, but uses a shorter addressing mode with
			single global 8-bit value for the high 8 bits of the
			address and any of several 8-bit registers for the low 8
			bits. AltOS uses a few bits of this memory, it should
			probably use more.

		==== __code

			All executable code must live in this address space, but
			you can stick read-only data here too. It is addressed
			using the 16-bit address register and special 'code'
			access opcodes. Anything read-only should live in this space.

		==== __bit

			The 8051 has 128 bits of bit-addressible memory that
			lives in the __data segment from 0x20 through
			0x2f. Special instructions access these bits
			in a single atomic operation. This isn't so much a
			separate address space as a special addressing mode for
			a few bytes in the __data segment.

		==== __sfr, __sfr16, __sfr32, __sbit

			Access to physical registers in the device use this mode
			which declares the variable name, its type and the
			address it lives at. No memory is allocated for these
			variables.

	=== Function calls on the 8051

		Because stack addressing is expensive, and stack space
		limited, the default function call declaration in SDCC
		allocates all parameters and local variables in static global
		memory. Just like fortran. This makes these functions
		non-reentrant, and also consume space for parameters and
		locals even when they are not running. The benefit is smaller
		code and faster execution.

		==== __reentrant functions

			All functions which are re-entrant, either due to recursion
			or due to a potential context switch while executing, should
			be marked as __reentrant so that their parameters and local
			variables get allocated on the stack. This ensures that
			these values are not overwritten by another invocation of
			the function.

			Functions which use significant amounts of space for
			arguments and/or local variables and which are not often
			invoked can also be marked as __reentrant. The resulting
			code will be larger, but the savings in memory are
			frequently worthwhile.

		==== Non __reentrant functions

			All parameters and locals in non-reentrant functions can
			have data space decoration so that they are allocated in
			__xdata, __pdata or __data space as desired. This can avoid
			consuming __data space for infrequently used variables in
			frequently used functions.

			All library functions called by SDCC, including functions
			for multiplying and dividing large data types, are
			non-reentrant. Because of this, interrupt handlers must not
			invoke any library functions, including the multiply and
			divide code.

		==== __interrupt functions

			Interrupt functions are declared with with an __interrupt
			decoration that includes the interrupt number. SDCC saves
			and restores all of the registers in these functions and
			uses the 'reti' instruction at the end so that they operate
			as stand-alone interrupt handlers. Interrupt functions may
			call the ao_wakeup function to wake AltOS tasks.

		==== __critical functions and statements

			SDCC has built-in support for suspending interrupts during
			critical code. Functions marked as __critical will have
			interrupts suspended for the whole period of
			execution. Individual statements may also be marked as
			__critical which blocks interrupts during the execution of
			that statement. Keeping critical sections as short as
			possible is key to ensuring that interrupts are handled as
			quickly as possible. AltOS doesn't use this form in shared
			code as other compilers wouldn't know what to do. Use
			ao_arch_block_interrupts and ao_arch_release_interrupts instead.

== Task functions

	This chapter documents how to create, destroy and schedule
	AltOS tasks.

	=== ao_add_task

		....
		\void
		\ao_add_task(__xdata struct ao_task * task,
		\	    void (*start)(void),
		\	    __code char *name);
		....

		This initializes the statically allocated task structure,
		assigns a name to it (not used for anything but the task
		display), and the start address. It does not switch to the
		new task. 'start' must not ever return; there is no place
		to return to.

	=== ao_exit

		....
		void
		ao_exit(void)
		....

		This terminates the current task.

	=== ao_sleep

		....
		void
		ao_sleep(__xdata void *wchan)
		....

		This suspends the current task until 'wchan' is signaled
		by ao_wakeup, or until the timeout, set by ao_alarm,
		fires. If 'wchan' is signaled, ao_sleep returns 0, otherwise
		it returns 1. This is the only way to switch to another task.

		Because ao_wakeup wakes every task waiting on a particular
		location, ao_sleep should be used in a loop that first checks
		the desired condition, blocks in ao_sleep and then rechecks
		until the condition is satisfied. If the location may be
		signaled from an interrupt handler, the code will need to
		block interrupts around the block of code. Here's a complete
		example:

		....
		\ao_arch_block_interrupts();
		\while (!ao_radio_done)
		\	ao_sleep(&amp;ao_radio_done);
		\ao_arch_release_interrupts();
		....

	=== ao_wakeup

		....
		void
		ao_wakeup(__xdata void *wchan)
		....

		Wake all tasks blocked on 'wchan'. This makes them
		available to be run again, but does not actually switch
		to another task. Here's an example of using this:

		....
		\if (RFIF &amp; RFIF_IM_DONE) {
		\	ao_radio_done = 1;
		\	ao_wakeup(&amp;ao_radio_done);
		\	RFIF &amp;= ~RFIF_IM_DONE;
		\}
		....

		Note that this need not block interrupts as the
		ao_sleep block can only be run from normal mode, and
		so this sequence can never be interrupted with
		execution of the other sequence.

	=== ao_alarm

		....
		void
		ao_alarm(uint16_t delay);

		void
		ao_clear_alarm(void);
		....

		Schedules an alarm to fire in at least 'delay'
		ticks. If the task is asleep when the alarm fires, it
		will wakeup and ao_sleep will return 1. ao_clear_alarm
		resets any pending alarm so that it doesn't fire at
		some arbitrary point in the future.

		....
		ao_alarm(ao_packet_master_delay);
		ao_arch_block_interrupts();
		while (!ao_radio_dma_done)
			if (ao_sleep(&amp;ao_radio_dma_done) != 0)
				ao_radio_abort();
		ao_arch_release_interrupts();
		ao_clear_alarm();
		....

		In this example, a timeout is set before waiting for
		incoming radio data. If no data is received before the
		timeout fires, ao_sleep will return 1 and then this
		code will abort the radio receive operation.

	=== ao_start_scheduler

		....
		void
		ao_start_scheduler(void);
		....

		This is called from 'main' when the system is all
		initialized and ready to run. It will not return.

	=== ao_clock_init

		....
		void
		ao_clock_init(void);
		....

		This initializes the main CPU clock and switches to it.

== Timer Functions

	AltOS sets up one of the CPU timers to run at 100Hz and
	exposes this tick as the fundemental unit of time. At each
	interrupt, AltOS increments the counter, and schedules any tasks
	waiting for that time to pass, then fires off the sensors to
	collect current data readings. Doing this from the ISR ensures
	that the values are sampled at a regular rate, independent
	of any scheduling jitter.

	=== ao_time

		....
		uint16_t
		ao_time(void)
		....

		Returns the current system tick count. Note that this is
		only a 16 bit value, and so it wraps every 655.36 seconds.

	=== ao_delay

		....
		void
		ao_delay(uint16_t ticks);
		....

		Suspend the current task for at least 'ticks' clock units.

	=== ao_timer_set_adc_interval

		....
		void
		ao_timer_set_adc_interval(uint8_t interval);
		....

		This sets the number of ticks between ADC samples. If set
		to 0, no ADC samples are generated. AltOS uses this to
		slow down the ADC sampling rate to save power.

	=== ao_timer_init

		....
		void
		ao_timer_init(void)
		....

		This turns on the 100Hz tick. It is required for any of the
		time-based functions to work. It should be called by 'main'
		before ao_start_scheduler.

== AltOS Mutexes

	AltOS provides mutexes as a basic synchronization primitive. Each
	mutexes is simply a byte of memory which holds 0 when the mutex
	is free or the task id of the owning task when the mutex is
	owned. Mutex calls are checked—attempting to acquire a mutex
	already held by the current task or releasing a mutex not held
	by the current task will both cause a panic.

	=== ao_mutex_get

		....
		void
		ao_mutex_get(__xdata uint8_t *mutex);
		....

		Acquires the specified mutex, blocking if the mutex is
		owned by another task.

	=== ao_mutex_put

		....
		void
		ao_mutex_put(__xdata uint8_t *mutex);
		....

		Releases the specified mutex, waking up all tasks waiting
		for it.

== DMA engine

	The CC1111 and STM32L both contain a useful bit of extra
	hardware in the form of a number of programmable DMA
	engines. They can be configured to copy data in memory, or
	between memory and devices (or even between two devices). AltOS
	exposes a general interface to this hardware and uses it to
	handle both internal and external devices.

	Because the CC1111 and STM32L DMA engines are different, the
	interface to them is also different. As the DMA engines are
	currently used to implement platform-specific drivers, this
	isn't yet a problem.

	Code using a DMA engine should allocate one at startup
	time. There is no provision to free them, and if you run out,
	AltOS will simply panic.

	During operation, the DMA engine is initialized with the
	transfer parameters. Then it is started, at which point it
	awaits a suitable event to start copying data. When copying data
	from hardware to memory, that trigger event is supplied by the
	hardware device. When copying data from memory to hardware, the
	transfer is usually initiated by software.

	=== CC1111 DMA Engine

		==== ao_dma_alloc

			....
			uint8_t
			ao_dma_alloc(__xdata uint8_t *done)
			....

			Allocate a DMA engine, returning the
			identifier.  'done' is cleared when the DMA is
			started, and then receives the AO_DMA_DONE bit
			on a successful transfer or the AO_DMA_ABORTED
			bit if ao_dma_abort was called. Note that it
			is possible to get both bits if the transfer
			was aborted after it had finished.

		==== ao_dma_set_transfer

			....
			void
			ao_dma_set_transfer(uint8_t id,
			void __xdata *srcaddr,
			void __xdata *dstaddr,
			uint16_t count,
			uint8_t cfg0,
			uint8_t cfg1)
			....

			Initializes the specified dma engine to copy
			data from 'srcaddr' to 'dstaddr' for 'count'
			units. cfg0 and cfg1 are values directly out
			of the CC1111 documentation and tell the DMA
			engine what the transfer unit size, direction
			and step are.

		==== ao_dma_start

			....
			void
			ao_dma_start(uint8_t id);
			....

			Arm the specified DMA engine and await a
			signal from either hardware or software to
			start transferring data.

		==== ao_dma_trigger

			....
			void
			ao_dma_trigger(uint8_t id)
			....

			Trigger the specified DMA engine to start
			copying data.

		==== ao_dma_abort

			....
			void
			ao_dma_abort(uint8_t id)
			....

			Terminate any in-progress DMA transaction,
			marking its 'done' variable with the
			AO_DMA_ABORTED bit.

	=== STM32L DMA Engine

		==== ao_dma_alloc

			....
			uint8_t ao_dma_done[];

			void
			ao_dma_alloc(uint8_t index);
			....

			Reserve a DMA engine for exclusive use by one
			driver.

		==== ao_dma_set_transfer

			....
			void
			ao_dma_set_transfer(uint8_t id,
			void *peripheral,
			void *memory,
			uint16_t count,
			uint32_t ccr);
			....

			Initializes the specified dma engine to copy
			data between 'peripheral' and 'memory' for
			'count' units. 'ccr' is a value directly out
			of the STM32L documentation and tells the DMA
			engine what the transfer unit size, direction
			and step are.

		==== ao_dma_set_isr

			....
			void
			ao_dma_set_isr(uint8_t index, void (*isr)(int))
			....

			This sets a function to be called when the DMA
			transfer completes in lieu of setting the
			ao_dma_done bits. Use this when some work
			needs to be done when the DMA finishes that
			cannot wait until user space resumes.

		==== ao_dma_start

			....
			void
			ao_dma_start(uint8_t id);
			....

			Arm the specified DMA engine and await a
			signal from either hardware or software to
			start transferring data.  'ao_dma_done[index]'
			is cleared when the DMA is started, and then
			receives the AO_DMA_DONE bit on a successful
			transfer or the AO_DMA_ABORTED bit if
			ao_dma_abort was called. Note that it is
			possible to get both bits if the transfer was
			aborted after it had finished.

		==== ao_dma_done_transfer

			....
			void
			ao_dma_done_transfer(uint8_t id);
			....

			Signals that a specific DMA engine is done
			being used. This allows multiple drivers to
			use the same DMA engine safely.

		==== ao_dma_abort

			....
			void
			ao_dma_abort(uint8_t id)
			....

			Terminate any in-progress DMA transaction,
			marking its 'done' variable with the
			AO_DMA_ABORTED bit.

== Stdio interface

	AltOS offers a stdio interface over USB, serial and the RF
	packet link. This provides for control of the device locally or
	remotely. This is hooked up to the stdio functions by providing
	the standard putchar/getchar/flush functions. These
	automatically multiplex the available communication channels;
	output is always delivered to the channel which provided the
	most recent input.

	=== putchar

		....
		void
		putchar(char c)
		....

		Delivers a single character to the current console
		device.

	=== getchar

		....
		char
		getchar(void)
		....

		Reads a single character from any of the available
		console devices. The current console device is set to
		that which delivered this character. This blocks until
		a character is available.

	=== flush

		....
		void
		flush(void)
		....

		Flushes the current console device output buffer. Any
		pending characters will be delivered to the target device.

	=== ao_add_stdio

		....
		void
		ao_add_stdio(char (*pollchar)(void),
				   void (*putchar)(char),
				   void (*flush)(void))
		....

		This adds another console device to the available
		list.

		'pollchar' returns either an available character or
		AO_READ_AGAIN if none is available. Significantly, it does
		not block. The device driver must set 'ao_stdin_ready' to
		1 and call ao_wakeup(&amp;ao_stdin_ready) when it receives
		input to tell getchar that more data is available, at
		which point 'pollchar' will be called again.

		'putchar' queues a character for output, flushing if the output buffer is
		full. It may block in this case.

		'flush' forces the output buffer to be flushed. It may
		block until the buffer is delivered, but it is not
		required to do so.

== Command line interface

	AltOS includes a simple command line parser which is hooked up
	to the stdio interfaces permitting remote control of the
	device over USB, serial or the RF link as desired. Each
	command uses a single character to invoke it, the remaining
	characters on the line are available as parameters to the
	command.

	=== ao_cmd_register

		....
		void
		ao_cmd_register(__code struct ao_cmds *cmds)
		....

		This registers a set of commands with the command
		parser. There is a fixed limit on the number of command
		sets, the system will panic if too many are registered.
		Each command is defined by a struct ao_cmds entry:

		....
		\struct ao_cmds {
		\	char		cmd;
		\	void		(*func)(void);
		\	const char	*help;
		\};
		....
		'cmd' is the character naming the command. 'func' is the
		function to invoke and 'help' is a string displayed by the
		'?' command. Syntax errors found while executing 'func'
		should be indicated by modifying the global ao_cmd_status
		variable with one of the following values:

		ao_cmd_success::

		The command was parsed successfully. There is no need
		to assign this value, it is the default.

		ao_cmd_lex_error::

		A token in the line was invalid, such as a number
		containing invalid characters. The low-level lexing
		functions already assign this value as needed.

		ao_syntax_error::

		The command line is invalid for some reason other than
		invalid tokens.

	=== ao_cmd_lex

		....
		void
		ao_cmd_lex(void);
		....

		This gets the next character out of the command line
		buffer and sticks it into ao_cmd_lex_c. At the end of
		the line, ao_cmd_lex_c will get a newline ('\n')
		character.

	=== ao_cmd_put16

		....
		void
		ao_cmd_put16(uint16_t v);
		....

		Writes 'v' as four hexadecimal characters.

	=== ao_cmd_put8

		....
		void
		ao_cmd_put8(uint8_t v);
		....

		Writes 'v' as two hexadecimal characters.

	=== ao_cmd_white

		....
		void
		ao_cmd_white(void)
		....

		This skips whitespace by calling ao_cmd_lex while
		ao_cmd_lex_c is either a space or tab. It does not
		skip any characters if ao_cmd_lex_c already non-white.

	=== ao_cmd_hex

		....
		void
		ao_cmd_hex(void)
		....

		This reads a 16-bit hexadecimal value from the command
		line with optional leading whitespace. The resulting
		value is stored in ao_cmd_lex_i;

	=== ao_cmd_decimal

		....
		void
		ao_cmd_decimal(void)
		....

		This reads a 32-bit decimal value from the command
		line with optional leading whitespace. The resulting
		value is stored in ao_cmd_lex_u32 and the low 16 bits
		are stored in ao_cmd_lex_i;

	=== ao_match_word

		....
		uint8_t
		ao_match_word(__code char *word)
		....

		This checks to make sure that 'word' occurs on the
		command line. It does not skip leading white space. If
		'word' is found, then 1 is returned. Otherwise,
		ao_cmd_status is set to ao_cmd_syntax_error and 0 is
		returned.

	=== ao_cmd_init

		....
		void
		ao_cmd_init(void
		....

		Initializes the command system, setting up the
		built-in commands and adding a task to run the command
		processing loop. It should be called by 'main' before
		ao_start_scheduler.

== USB target device

	AltOS contains a full-speed USB target device driver. It can
	be programmed to offer any kind of USB target, but to simplify
	interactions with a variety of operating systems, AltOS
	provides only a single target device profile, that of a USB
	modem which has native drivers for Linux, Windows and Mac OS
	X. It would be easy to change the code to provide an alternate
	target device if necessary.

	To the rest of the system, the USB device looks like a simple
	two-way byte stream. It can be hooked into the command line
	interface if desired, offering control of the device over the
	USB link. Alternatively, the functions can be accessed
	directly to provide for USB-specific I/O.

	=== ao_usb_flush

		....
		void
		ao_usb_flush(void);
		....

		Flushes any pending USB output. This queues an 'IN'
		packet to be delivered to the USB host if there is
		pending data, or if the last IN packet was full to
		indicate to the host that there isn't any more pending
		data available.

	=== ao_usb_putchar

		....
		void
		ao_usb_putchar(char c);
		....

		If there is a pending 'IN' packet awaiting delivery to
		the host, this blocks until that has been
		fetched. Then, this adds a byte to the pending IN
		packet for delivery to the USB host. If the USB packet
		is full, this queues the 'IN' packet for delivery.

	=== ao_usb_pollchar

		....
		char
		ao_usb_pollchar(void);
		....

		If there are no characters remaining in the last 'OUT'
		packet received, this returns
		AO_READ_AGAIN. Otherwise, it returns the next
		character, reporting to the host that it is ready for
		more data when the last character is gone.

	=== ao_usb_getchar

		....
		char
		ao_usb_getchar(void);
		....

		This uses ao_pollchar to receive the next character,
		blocking while ao_pollchar returns AO_READ_AGAIN.

	=== ao_usb_disable

		....
		void
		ao_usb_disable(void);
		....

		This turns off the USB controller. It will no longer
		respond to host requests, nor return
		characters. Calling any of the i/o routines while the
		USB device is disabled is undefined, and likely to
		break things. Disabling the USB device when not needed
		saves power.

		Note that neither TeleDongle v0.2 nor TeleMetrum v1
		are able to signal to the USB host that they have
		disconnected, so after disabling the USB device, it's
		likely that the cable will need to be disconnected and
		reconnected before it will work again.

	=== ao_usb_enable

		....
		void
		ao_usb_enable(void);
		....

		This turns the USB controller on again after it has
		been disabled. See the note above about needing to
		physically remove and re-insert the cable to get the
		host to re-initialize the USB link.

	=== ao_usb_init

		....
		void
		ao_usb_init(void);
		....

		This turns the USB controller on, adds a task to
		handle the control end point and adds the usb I/O
		functions to the stdio system. Call this from main
		before ao_start_scheduler.

== Serial peripherals

	The CC1111 provides two USART peripherals. AltOS uses one for
	asynch serial data, generally to communicate with a GPS
	device, and the other for a SPI bus. The UART is configured to
	operate in 8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit framing. The default
	configuration has clock settings for 4800, 9600 and 57600 baud
	operation. Additional speeds can be added by computing
	appropriate clock values.

	To prevent loss of data, AltOS provides receive and transmit
	fifos of 32 characters each.

	=== ao_serial_getchar

		....
		char
		ao_serial_getchar(void);
		....

		Returns the next character from the receive fifo, blocking
		until a character is received if the fifo is empty.

	=== ao_serial_putchar

		....
		void
		ao_serial_putchar(char c);
		....

		Adds a character to the transmit fifo, blocking if the
		fifo is full. Starts transmitting characters.

	=== ao_serial_drain

		....
		void
		ao_serial_drain(void);
		....

		Blocks until the transmit fifo is empty. Used internally
		when changing serial speeds.

	=== ao_serial_set_speed

		....
		void
		ao_serial_set_speed(uint8_t speed);
		....

		Changes the serial baud rate to one of
		AO_SERIAL_SPEED_4800, AO_SERIAL_SPEED_9600 or
		AO_SERIAL_SPEED_57600. This first flushes the transmit
		fifo using ao_serial_drain.

	=== ao_serial_init

		....
		void
		ao_serial_init(void)
		....

		Initializes the serial peripheral. Call this from 'main'
		before jumping to ao_start_scheduler. The default speed
		setting is AO_SERIAL_SPEED_4800.

== CC1111/CC1120/CC1200 Radio peripheral

	=== Radio Introduction

		The CC1111, CC1120 and CC1200 radio transceiver sends
		and receives digital packets with forward error
		correction and detection. The AltOS driver is fairly
		specific to the needs of the TeleMetrum and TeleDongle
		devices, using it for other tasks may require
		customization of the driver itself. There are three
		basic modes of operation:

		. Telemetry mode. In this mode, TeleMetrum transmits telemetry
		  frames at a fixed rate. The frames are of fixed size. This
		  is strictly a one-way communication from TeleMetrum to
		  TeleDongle.

		. Packet mode. In this mode, the radio is used to create a
		  reliable duplex byte stream between TeleDongle and
		  TeleMetrum. This is an asymmetrical protocol with
		  TeleMetrum only transmitting in response to a packet sent
		  from TeleDongle. Thus getting data from TeleMetrum to
		  TeleDongle requires polling. The polling rate is adaptive,
		  when no data has been received for a while, the rate slows
		  down. The packets are checked at both ends and invalid data
		  are ignored.

		  On the TeleMetrum side, the packet link is hooked into the
		  stdio mechanism, providing an alternate data path for the
		  command processor. It is enabled when the unit boots up in
		  'idle' mode.

		  On the TeleDongle side, the packet link is enabled with a
		  command; data from the stdio package is forwarded over the
		  packet link providing a connection from the USB command
		  stream to the remote TeleMetrum device.

		. Radio Direction Finding mode. In this mode, TeleMetrum
		  constructs a special packet that sounds like an audio tone
		  when received by a conventional narrow-band FM
		  receiver. This is designed to provide a beacon to track the
		  device when other location mechanisms fail.

	=== ao_radio_set_telemetry

		....
		void
		ao_radio_set_telemetry(void);
		....

		Configures the radio to send or receive telemetry
		packets. This includes packet length, modulation scheme and
		other RF parameters. It does not include the base frequency
		or channel though. Those are set at the time of transmission
		or reception, in case the values are changed by the user.

	=== ao_radio_set_packet

		....
		void
		ao_radio_set_packet(void);
		....

		Configures the radio to send or receive packet data.  This
		includes packet length, modulation scheme and other RF
		parameters. It does not include the base frequency or
		channel though. Those are set at the time of transmission or
		reception, in case the values are changed by the user.

	=== ao_radio_set_rdf

		....
		void
		ao_radio_set_rdf(void);
		....

		Configures the radio to send RDF 'packets'. An RDF 'packet'
		is a sequence of hex 0x55 bytes sent at a base bit rate of
		2kbps using a 5kHz deviation. All of the error correction
		and data whitening logic is turned off so that the resulting
		modulation is received as a 1kHz tone by a conventional 70cm
		FM audio receiver.

	=== ao_radio_idle

		....
		void
		ao_radio_idle(void);
		....

		Sets the radio device to idle mode, waiting until it reaches
		that state. This will terminate any in-progress transmit or
		receive operation.

	=== ao_radio_get

		....
		void
		ao_radio_get(void);
		....

		Acquires the radio mutex and then configures the radio
		frequency using the global radio calibration and channel
		values.

	=== ao_radio_put

		....
		void
		ao_radio_put(void);
		....

		Releases the radio mutex.

	=== ao_radio_abort

		....
		void
		ao_radio_abort(void);
		....

		Aborts any transmission or reception process by aborting the
		associated DMA object and calling ao_radio_idle to terminate
		the radio operation.

	=== Radio Telemetry

		In telemetry mode, you can send or receive a telemetry
		packet. The data from receiving a packet also includes the RSSI
		and status values supplied by the receiver. These are added
		after the telemetry data.

		==== ao_radio_send

		....
		void
		ao_radio_send(__xdata struct ao_telemetry *telemetry);
		....

		This sends the specific telemetry packet, waiting for the
		transmission to complete. The radio must have been set to
		telemetry mode. This function calls ao_radio_get() before
		sending, and ao_radio_put() afterwards, to correctly
		serialize access to the radio device.

		==== ao_radio_recv

		....
		void
		ao_radio_recv(__xdata struct ao_radio_recv *radio);
		....

		This blocks waiting for a telemetry packet to be received.
		The radio must have been set to telemetry mode. This
		function calls ao_radio_get() before receiving, and
		ao_radio_put() afterwards, to correctly serialize access
		to the radio device. This returns non-zero if a packet was
		received, or zero if the operation was aborted (from some
		other task calling ao_radio_abort()).

	=== Radio Direction Finding

		In radio direction finding mode, there's just one function to
		use

		==== ao_radio_rdf

		....
		void
		ao_radio_rdf(int ms);
		....

		This sends an RDF packet lasting for the specified amount
		of time. The maximum length is 1020 ms.

	=== Radio Packet Mode

		Packet mode is asymmetrical and is configured at compile time
		for either master or slave mode (but not both). The basic I/O
		functions look the same at both ends, but the internals are
		different, along with the initialization steps.

		==== ao_packet_putchar

			....
			void
			ao_packet_putchar(char c);
			....

			If the output queue is full, this first blocks waiting for
			that data to be delivered. Then, queues a character for
			packet transmission. On the master side, this will
			transmit a packet if the output buffer is full. On the
			slave side, any pending data will be sent the next time
			the master polls for data.

		==== ao_packet_pollchar

			....
			char
			ao_packet_pollchar(void);
			....

			This returns a pending input character if available,
			otherwise returns AO_READ_AGAIN. On the master side, if
			this empties the buffer, it triggers a poll for more data.

		==== ao_packet_slave_start

			....
			void
			ao_packet_slave_start(void);
			....

			This is available only on the slave side and starts a task
			to listen for packet data.

		==== ao_packet_slave_stop

			....
			void
			ao_packet_slave_stop(void);
			....

			Disables the packet slave task, stopping the radio receiver.

		==== ao_packet_slave_init

			....
			void
			ao_packet_slave_init(void);
			....

			Adds the packet stdio functions to the stdio package so
			that when packet slave mode is enabled, characters will
			get send and received through the stdio functions.

		==== ao_packet_master_init

			....
			void
			ao_packet_master_init(void);
			....

			Adds the 'p' packet forward command to start packet mode.
